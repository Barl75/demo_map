# demo_map

This repository has been created for hosting an interactive map created with qgis2web plugin. Related to a blog post.

You can take a look to the web page containing the embedded version of the interactive map at https://gispocoding.github.io/demo_map/ or jump right on to exploring the map at the full extent at https://gispocoding.github.io/demo_map/map.html

Inspired greatly by https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/07-Mapping/03-Publish-Your-Map.html#github-pages

# Noteworthy

Inspiration for this map originated from free-time duties in organizing the bachelorette party; hence the content :) The data set of pubs reflects only one subjective opinion on which pubs might be worth a visit (and why). The decisions on whether to include a certain pub into the custom data set or not are based on exhausting internet browsing.

# Usage

With this interactive map you can
- control visibility of the layers (layer menu exists in the right upper corner)
- pan the map
- zoom in or out
- geolocate yourself
- measure distances (start the measurement with one click and stop with double click)
- search for addresses or place names (e.g. kungliga slottet)

## Data sources
