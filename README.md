# demo_map

This repository has been created for hosting a web map created with qgis2web plugin. Related to a blog post.

You can take a look to the web page containing the embedded version of the interactive map at https://gispocoding.github.io/demo_map/ or jump right on to exploring the map at the full extent at https://gispocoding.github.io/demo_map/map.html

# Noteworthy

Inspiration for this map originated from free-time duties in organizing the bachelorette party; hence the content :) The data set of pubs reflects only one subjective opinion on which pubs might be worth a visit (and why). The decisions on whether to include a certain pub into the custom data set or not are based on exhausting internet browsing.
